[32m+[m[32myogic methods, or it can be said that all yogic methods are only the body and limbs of[m
[32m+[m[32mthese two. Therefore, some of what has been said about these two subjects by the most[m
[32m+[m[32mesteemed sages is being explained below.[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mMaharshi Patanjali has written about this subject in the book named "Yogasutra" in this[m
[32m+[m[32mway: that just as when a certain type of substance is mixed with a different type of[m
[32m+[m[32msubstance, a change occurs in the natural condition of the original substance and thereby[m
[32m+[m[32mthat substance transforms to a mutated state, in the same way, when consciousness[m
[32m+[m[32mmingles with external matters of sound, touch, sight, taste and sound etc., it becomes[m
[32m+[m[32mattached to them and a change of its natural condition occurs, because of which it then[m
[32m+[m[32mexists in a distorted condition. Thus, if it is not able to abstain from all those things,[m
[32m+[m[32mconsciousness can never reside in its natural state.[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mIf consciousness is able to abstain from things in order to remain in its natural state, then[m
[32m+[m[32mgradually, four states of being, one after another, arise in consciousness. First, by[m
[32m+[m[32mdiscerning the transitory nature of things and becoming aware of its own corrupted[m
[32m+[m[32mcondition, an effortful state emerges within consciousness, with consciousness wanting to[m
[32m+[m[32mattain its natural state of being. The scriptural saints call this effortful condition the[m
[32m+[m[32m‚Äúyataman avastha‚Äù of consciousness. After this, consciousness gradually continues to[m
[32m+[m[32mdiscard the causes of its distortions. This type condition of consciousness in the scriptures[m
[32m+[m[32mis called ‚Äúvyatirek avastha.‚Äù Then, the distorted conditions in consciousness that still occur[m
[32m+[m[32mbecause of attachment to previous tendencies [samskaras] from time to time even after[m
[32m+[m[32mhaving eradicated all causes [of corruption] are brought into awareness, and the state[m
[32m+[m[32mattained by consciousness from wanting to achieve peace from that is called in the[m
[32m+[m[32mscriptures as "ekindriyavastha." After that, when all distortions and even their samskaras[m
[32m+[m[32mare eliminated, a type of peaceful state of being is obtained where any types of matters[m
[32m+[m[32mrelating to visible things or supernatural intimations -- no kinds of desires for anything can[m
[32m+[m[32marise. Always, consciousness remains in its natural state. This is what the scripturral saints[m
[32m+[m[32mhave called as the "vashikar avastha" of consciousness. Maharshi Patanjali has called this[m
